I"ô<p>It all started with 1G and presently we are dealing with 4G LTE. But demands for higher data speeds, higher
bandwidth applications have increased tremendously and had set the stage for 5G technology to take
over and cater to the following demands:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Smart Cities</li>
  <li>Vehicle to Everything(V2X) in Intelligent Transport Systems</li>
  <li>E-Health/Cloud Robotic Surgeries</li>
  <li>5G in IoT</li>
  <li>Remote Control of Industries</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Today, we are using the same radio frequency ( <em>6 GHz</em> ) bands for our data and voice telephony
making those bands congested and increasing delays. This problem can be solved by
implementing the <strong>mm Wave</strong> technology which works on completely different frequencies of
<em>30GHz to 300GHz</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/assets/images/freq5g.jpg" alt="mm wave" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>But the problem is, these canâ€™t pass through buildings and easily sabotage to bad weather. This
problem can be solved using the availability of traditional towers where we can augment <strong>small</strong>
<strong>cells</strong> every quarter kilometer which will work as relay-network. Small Cells are small portable base
stations.</li>
  <li>5G base stations can support about a hundred ports, which means more antennas can fit on a
single array which can be used for <strong>massive MIMO (Multi Input Multi Output)</strong> implementation
which increases the network capacity by a factor of 22, but increases interference as well.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li>The <strong>Beamforming</strong> technique can reduce interference and delivers the data through the most
efficient route complimenting <em>massive MIMO</em>.</li>
  <li>Besides all these, we can try to even lower the latency and produce high throughput using <strong>full</strong>
<strong>duplex</strong> implementation. Picture two trains going through each other using the same route but
not destroying each other. Thatâ€™s <em>Full Duplex</em> in a nutshell.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="current-state-of-5g-deployment">Current State of 5G Deployment</h2>

<p>According to a report titled <em>THE STATE OF 5G DEPLOYMENTS</em> by <em>VIAVI</em> , 5G is spread across 378 cities of 3 4
countries around the globe (as of January 2020). South Korea with 85 cities tops the chart while China and
US follow with 57 and 50 cities respectively. UK with 31 cities comes next to the tally.</p>

<h2 id="most-beneficial-use-cases-for-us">Most Beneficial Use Cases for us</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Robotic Surgery</strong> : Imagine a doctor doing surgery without even going close to the patient and by
just operating a robot from a whole different place or even a continent. Thatâ€™s possible due to the
<em>low latency</em> 5G application.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/images/doc5g.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Immersive entertainment</strong> : AR-VR applications found great use of <em>low latency and high data rates</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Video surveillance</strong> : Connected drones can be used to monitor one local geographical area and
mapping it for analysis purposes.</li>
  <li><strong>Connected Vehicles</strong> : Where vehicles communicate with almost everything and are smart enough
to self-drive. Note 5G is a very good accessory for a self-driving vehicle but not the only one.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-5g-is-not-about-and-its-shortcomings">What 5G is NOT about and its shortcomings</h2>

<p>5G is not here to eliminate the existing 4G environment, rather it should be used in conjunction with
previous generation networks to cater to specific demands. Itâ€™s still not so reliable under indoors and the
5G network that we will be getting in the near future is not the high-speed 5G which uses <em>mm Wave</em> but
will be <em>Sub 6GHz 5G</em> but that is still faster than fastest of 4G. Implementation of 5G will definitely improve
the lives of humans and we will be ever more connected with devices and our work culture will
substantially change for a good.</p>

<p>5G implementation around the globe is done in small clusters and we are yet to see these in India. Surely
the <em>novel coronavirus (SARS COV2)</em> pandemic has thrashed the 5G and 5G+ plans, but the world will sooner
pick its pace and we will be able to enjoy the services which it has to offer.</p>
