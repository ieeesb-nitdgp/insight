I"E<p>Cryptocurrencies are just a medium of exchange, they are a way to carry out transactions
digitally. They are digital currencies which are completely independent of government control or
a central authority or a server. They are completely on their own.
You may be wondering how this sort of system differs from Paytm, Google pay, Amazon pay or
the digital banking app you have on your phone. They certainly appear to serve the same use
on the surface – paying friends, making purchases from your favorite website – but under the
hood, they couldn’t be more different.</p>
