Quite fascinating and admittedly a bit eerie at the same time, **Artificial Intelligence** is now making the Mona Lisa speak!  

This means that the famous "_Nothing is impossible_" quote is now coming true. AI is attempting to achieve the impossible as the **Samsung AI Research Centre** in Moscow released a study in which they use the "Deepfake" technique to bring to life  Leonardo Da Vinci's antique painting 'Mona Lisa'.  

The model is documented in a paper published by Samsung AI Center, which can be read [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08233).  

**Deepfakes** or Living Portraits is a technique used in AI which uses convolutional neural networks to analyze and process images much like the human brain does. Traditionally, such duplicates were made using a technique called Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), in which the machine simply attempted to forge a lifelike image.  

Producing deepfakes is not an easy job as human heads are geometrically complex and highly dynamic; three-dimensional models of heads have "tens of millions of parameters," said the authors of the study.  

But Samsung's new technique scans for facial "landmarks" and reduces the image to just a nose, mouth, eyes, eyebrows and a chin to produce a sequence of entirely novel facial expressions that seem to give the images a real personality.  

This technique is now also being used to create realistic videos from photos of 20th-century cultural icons such as _Albert Einstein, Marilyn Monroe, and Salvador Dali_!

Although this is a great advancement in AI, some people have questioned these developments as this technology could be used for nefarious purposes too. Since deepfakes are videos that realistically superimpose a person's face and body in videos _that did not originally contain them_, the system can be used by a vast network of publishers and proprietors of fake news.  

Thus **Elon Musk**, founder of Tesla and SpaceX, once expressed his concerns over AI by saying :  
>When there is an evil dictator, that human dies. But for AI, there will be no death – it would live forever.
>And then you would have an immortal  dictator from which we could never escape.
